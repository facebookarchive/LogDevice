/**
 * @file  a Socket is an endpoint of a connection that can send and
 *        receive messages.  Internally a Socket encapsulates a bufferevent
 *        running in a libevent 2.x event loop on a Worker thread. Sockets are
 *        not shared between Worker threads. All operations on a Socket,
 *        including its creation, must be performed on the same thread.
 */

// A note on memory management for Sockets.
//
// Every Socket object is emplaced on a map with the address of the
// peer end as key. The map is local to a Worker object on which
// the Socket runs. Upper layers of LD code, such as Request objects,
// are not expected to send messages directly into Sockets. Instead
// they send them through Sender objects (one per Worker) to a
// destination Address, which can be a client or a server address. The
// Sender looks up a Socket by address and sends the Message into that
// Socket. If no Socket is found for Address, an error is reported. When
// the socket is no longer needed it is erased from its map. Pointers to
// Sockets are not stored anywhere other than in the address map and in
// local variables. Since Sockets are not shared among threads, this
// guarantees that when a Socket is destroyed, no dangling pointers are
// left around.
//
// This is an alternative to passing shared_ptr<Socket>s around. I find it
// simpler and more transparent than using shared pointers. The disadvantage
// is that this will work only if Sockets cannot be shared among threads, but
// that is currently not needed.

// Defined later in this file.
