/**
 * @file Wrapper for a BufferedWriter instance that runs on sequencers,
 * allowing them to batch incoming appends together.  The benefit is fewer,
 * larger, records stored in the system, which usually improves efficiency.
 * The downsides are: different clients will get back the same LSN when
 * appending, lesser ordering guarantees (some writes may get batched, others
 * may not), and the buffering introduces a (configurable) latency penalty.
 *
 * The implementation is somewhat complex due to threading and integration
 * requirements.  The rough flow is:
 *
 * - APPEND messages come in from clients.
 *
 * - The processing path for an APPEND message consults SequencerBatching,
 *   offering to buffer the append for batching.  If SequencerBatching decides
 *   to buffer (based on settings and its discretion e.g. the payload size),
 *   it claims ownership of the append; processing of the APPEND message stops
 *   there.
 *
 * - If the incoming APPEND had itself come from a client using
 *   BufferedWriter, that is decompressed and unpacked before handing to
 *   BufferedWriter.  (BufferedWriter will later recompress when flushing.
 *   This is an extra compression round trip which costs CPU, however there is
 *   typically improved compression because the batches are larger.  It also
 *   avoids the need to handle batches-of-batches on the read path.)
 *
 * - The SequencerBatching::AppendMessageState struct tracks the state for one
 *   such incoming APPEND message, which may be one or more records now in
 *   BufferedWriter (more if we unpacked in the previous step).
 *
 * - All of the above happens on the worker thread that received the APPEND
 *   message.  However, BufferedWriter is single-threaded per log so it
 *   internally needs to hand the batch of records to the correct worker
 *   thread via a Request.
 *
 * - Once BufferedWriter decides to flush a batch for a log, it calls back
 *   into SequencerBatching::appendBuffered(), on the one worker thread
 *   handling buffering for that log within BufferedWriter.  That creates an
 *   Appender and has the Sequencer process it.  It uses most of the same code
 *   used to process incoming APPEND messages (currently in the class
 *   AppenderPrep).
 *
 * - Unlike the normal (unbatched) append path, that Appender does not
 *   directly send an APPENDED reply but invokes a callback,
 *   BatchedAppendRequest::onReplyReceived().  This callback just forwards to
 *   BufferedWriter's generic append callback.  The BufferedWriter generic
 *   append callback finds the relevant contexts (which are really pointers to
 *   AppendMessageState instances) and calls SequencerBatching::onReply() or
 *   onFailure().
 *
 * - SequencerBatching::onReply/onFailure receive as input a set of
 *   AppendMessageState instances that were in the buffered write sent to
 *   storage nodes.  These contain appends that came in on **different**
 *   workers so it needs to distribute them to the right workers via Requests.
 *
 * - Once on the correct worker, these Requests finally send APPENDED replies
 *   to the client and destroy the right AppendMessageState instances.
 *
 * - Phew!
