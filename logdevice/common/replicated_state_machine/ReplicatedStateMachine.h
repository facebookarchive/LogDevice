/**
 * ReplicatedStateMachine is a utility for building a distributed replicated
 * state machine backed by two logs, a snapshot log which contains serialized
 * versioned snapshots of the state, and a delta log which contains ordered
 * serialized deltas to be applied on a snapshot. The state is versioned, and
 * that version is the LSN of the last delta record that was applied.
 *
 * Users can subscribe to this state machine to get notified when the state
 * changes. On startup, the state machine performs a "replay" procedure which
 * consists in syncing the local state with the current state. This is
 * effectively done by reading the last snapshot record in the snapshot log and
 * then reading the backlog of delta records from the delta log, starting from
 * the version of that snapshot. Once the replay procedure is complete,
 * subscribers get notified of the initial state, and new updates are
 * streamed to subscribers in real-time as they arrive.
 *
 * Users can mutate the state by writing deltas. Deltas are unconditionally
 * appended to the delta log, but may or may not be applied as they are read.
 * There are two modes of writing deltas. With the first mode
 * (CONFIRM_APPEND_ONLY), the user does not wish to be informed whether or not
 * the delta is actually applied after appended. The user gets a confirmation
 * immediately after the append succeeds. With the second mode
 * (CONFIRM_APPLIED), the user gets a confirmation after the local state is
 * synced to a version past that delta, and is notified whether the delta was
 * applied or not. This way of handling concurrent writes works well for
 * state machines that have a low update rate.
 *
 * This class is templated by two types. T is the state type. The user is
 * required to provide serialization and deserialization methods for it by
 * overriding the `deserializeState` and `serializeState` methods. D is the type
 * of the delta. The user is required to provide a deserialization method by
 * overriding `deserializeDelta` as well as `applyDelta` which mutates a state
 * of type T with a delta of type D. `applyDelta` may fail if the delta is
 * stale, in that case the delta is skipped and the state is not mutated.
 *
 * This class provides a `snapshot` method which the user can use to serialize
 * the current local state onto a new snapshot record and append it to the
 * snapshot log. That method cannot be used while we are replaying the backlog.
 * This class maintains some metadata about the delta log such as the number of
 * delta records seen as well as the number of bytes seen. This metadata is also
 * included in snapshots so it is never lost and used to estimate the amount of
 * records/bytes that are in the delta log but have never been snapshotted. The
 * user relies on this information to decide when to create a new snapshot.
 *
 * If this state machine misses data when reading the delta log (because it sees
 * a DATALOSS or TRIM gap), it will stall until a snapshot record is received
 * for a version past the higher end of that gap. If the gap was a TRIM gap,
 * hopefully another entity decided to create a snapshot and then trimmed the
 * delta log so it is reasonnable to expect a snapshot will be received shortly.
 * If the gap was a DATALOSS gap and no one ever wrote a snapshot that accounted
 * for the lost deltas, the state machine will stall until a human manually
 * writes a snapshot.
 *
 * Limitations and TODOs:
 *
 * TODO(T13475700): If recovery completed and we were able to retrieve the
 * last_released_real_lsn, the current replay mechanism only tries to read the
 * last snapshot record from the snapshot log. It is theoretically possible to
 * have unordered snapshot record, ie that the last snapshot is not the most
 * recent one. This is not a big deal if the delta log is not trimmed
 * aggresively.  If we want to trim the delta log aggressively after creating a
 * snapshot, we might need to add some logic to make this safer.
 *
 * TODO(T13475700): the replay mechanism depends on recovery completing.
 * We may consider relaxing this and allowing streaming updates to subscribers
 * when the state machine is past the current last released lsn instead of the
 * curren tail.
 * It is still unclear if we'd rather give a stale version or nothing at all
 * (and stall) when recovery has not completed.
