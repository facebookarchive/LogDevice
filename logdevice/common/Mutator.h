/**
 * @file Mutator is a state machine that performs mutation for one single
 *       record on the set of nodes from which EpochRecovery receives its
 *       digest. The main purpose of mutation is to ensure that the particular
 *       esn slot is in a consistent state across all storage nodes in the
 *       digest set. It mainly does the following:
 *          1) amend record metadata stored on the nodes in amend_metadata
 *          2) overwrite record stored on the nodes in conflict_copies
 *          3) replicate the consensus record to other nodes until the set of
 *             nodes that stored the consensus record (including nodes in
 *             amend_metadata and conflict_copies) satisfy the replication
 *             requirement for this epoch.
 *
 *       In addition, currently Mutator requires all stores and amends must be
 *       done in the same wave. This is to guarantee that there are at least
 *       a set of nodes in the mutation set that end up with the a consistent
 *       and accurate copyset (copyset contains exactly the nodes fully stored
 *       and is the same across the set of nodes). This is not strictly
 *       required by log recovery, but is currently crucial to rebuilding
 *       for ensuring the record gets properly re-replicated.
 *
 *       All Mutators are owned by EpochRecovery objects and reside in
 *       EpochRecovery::mutation_ maps. When a mutator is done, it must call
 *       onMutationComplete() of its containing EpochRecovery object, which
 *       will remove the Mutator from the map and destroy it.
