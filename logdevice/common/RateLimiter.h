/**
 * @file RateLimiter is a helper class used to check if the number (or total
 *       weight) of executed operations per unit of time exceeded the limit.
 *
 *       Thread safe (except for assignment operator).
 *
 *       There are 3 main ways to use it:
 *        1. Whenever you want to do an operation, call isAllowed(). If it
 *           returns true, go ahead and do it, otherwise try again later.
 *           Possible problems are that it's not clear how much later to retry,
 *           and if there are many state machines using the same RateLimiter,
 *           the total amount of retries may be high.
 *        2. Whenever you want to do an operation, call waitUntilAllowed(), then
 *           do the operation. waitUntilAllowed() will block the current thread,
 *           so it only makes sense if the thread doesn't have anything
 *           else to do.
 *        3. Whenever you want to do an operation, call isAllowed() with
 *           non-null time_until_allowed, wait for the returned amount of time,
 *           then do the operation. This is the most flexible mode.
 *
 *       The main limitations are:
 *        a. You need to know the cost of the operation in advance.
 *        b. The reservation is made at time of call to isAllowed().
 *           If, before that time elapses, you change your mind about doing the
 *           operation, the reserved budget is wasted. (Maybe this can be made a
 *           little better by adding a method to "unreserve" a given cost,
 *           but that has its own problems and doesn't seem like a good idea.)
 *       To solve these problems, one would need a different kind of rate
 *       limiter, having a queue of parties (callbacks?) waiting for their turn.
 *
 *       RateLimiters are used as static objects in some places.
 *       Because LogDevice may not
 *       always terminate cleanly (unit tests, abnormal termination), some code
 *       may call into static RateLimiter objects after they have been
 *       destroyed. This is undefined behavior, but does not cause issues
 *       currently, because this class has no virtual functions and only a small
 *       number of primitive data members. Adding data members or virtual
 *       functions may cause crashes however.

// Imagine the rate limiter as a bucket, continuously filling with water at
// a rate limit_per_second units per second. The size of the bucket is so
// that it takes `burst_limit` time to fill from zero to full. An operation
// instantaneously consumes `cost` units of water from the bucket.
// The water level is allowed to go negative. An operation is allowed
// whenever the water level is nonnegative.
//
// It turns out that to simulate such a bucket it's enough to maintain a
// single number: the time at which water level did or will hit zero.
// Which is nice because it allows making everything lock-free by making this
// number atomic and doing everything in CAS loops.
//
// (Another way would be to maintain the level at time 0. But that would be less
//  robust because then we'd have to do everything in floating-point numbers
//  and often subtract numbers that are close to each other, and 64-bit numbers
//  would barely have enough precision for that.)
