   * Attempts to send a message to a specified Address, which can identify

   *             call succeeds, retains ownership on failure.
   *
   * @param addr address to send the message to. If this is a client address,
   *             the call succeeds only if a Socket wrapping a TCP connection
   *             accepted from that client is already running on this Worker.
   *             If addr is a server address for which there is no Socket
   *             on this Worker, the function attempts to create one.
   *             If it's a server address, and generation() == 0, takes the
   *             generation from the current config.
   *

   *                callbacks that the Socket through which the message gets
   *                sent will call on this Worker thread when that Socket is

   *                `on_bw_avail` and `onclose`, and the socket closes while

   *

   *                NOTE b: it is safe for caller to destroy the callback while
   *                        it is installed. Callback's destructor will remove
   *                        it from list.
