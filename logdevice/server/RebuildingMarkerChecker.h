/**
 * @file RebuildingMarkerChecker checks the rebuilding markers
 * (RebuildingCompleteMetadata) in the local store and returns the status of
 * each shard.
 * The algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * If this node's generation is 1 or the shard is in PROVISIONING state, write
 * RebuildingCheckpointMetadata for each shard and mark it as not missing data.
 * Also, transition the node out of the PROVISIONING state to NONE if NCM is
 * enabled.
 *
 * If this node's generation is >1, try and retrieve the
 * RebuildingCheckpointMetadata for each shard. For each shard:
 * - If the marker does exist, mark the shard as not missing data.
 * - If the marker does not exist, we mark it as missing data.
 *   Once it is rebuilt, we will write the RebuildingCheckpointMetadata before
 *   we send SHARD_ACK_REBUILT in the event log.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, or -1 on failure.
