/**
 * @file RecordCache caches records for a log that are not yet confirmed as
 *       fully stored by the sequencer. Its entries are stored records whose esn
 *       are greater than the maximum seen LNG (last known good esn) of the
 *       epoch so far on the storage node. For such reason, records are
 *       maintained and managed by a per-epoch sub-cache EpochRecordCache, and
 *       RecordCache maintains a window of EpochRecordCache objects for each
 *       _unclean_ epoch for the log on the storage node. Records of cleaned
 *       epochs, on the other hand, are never used for log recovery afterwards
 *       and do not need to be cached. Therefore, as the last clean epoch
 *       advances on the storage node (e.g., after purging), EpochRecordCache
 *       objects for these epochs are also dropped. Providing an in-memory cache
 *       for unclean records improves the efficiency of the log recovery
 *       procedure as it no longer needs to access the local log store and
 *       perform potentially expensive seek operations during the Sealing and
 *       Digesting phases.
