/**
 * Entry point for all incoming requests to LogDevice Thrift API.
 *
 * Unfortunately Thrift does not support mutliple inheritance so we have to have
 * single interface and thus single top-level handler class. In order to make it
 * manageable we split this single handler into multiple, each of them
 * responsible for its own subset of API and later assmble them together into
 * single class using inheritance.
 * The overall (simplified) inheritance graph looks like this:
 *
 *                       LogDeviceAPISvIf
 *                    (generated Thrift API)
 *                                |
 *                      ThriftApiHandlerBase
 *        (to share some pieces of implementation between handlers)
 *                     /          |            \
 *          CompatHandler    OtherHandler    OneMoreHandler
 *                      \         |           /
 *                     LogDeviceAPIThriftHandler
 *            (top level class injected into Thrift server)
