  // The reader will maintain a separate state for each Client-log pair. Hence
  // the identifier used in this unordered map is a pair of uint64_t (for the
  // Client's writer ID) and log ID. Each Client-log pair is mapped to an
  // ordered map from sequence numbers to a boolean. The reason we are using an
  // ordered map and not, say, a bitset is that we need to store 3 states: not
  // present (i.e. has not been read), present in the list with bool value false
  // (i.e. was read but not acked), and present in the list with
  // bool value true (i.e. was read and was acked).
  // We also store the VerificationAppendInfo FROM THE READER to check against
  // the VerificationAppendInfo from the callback later (they should match).
  // Note that the acked indicator is kept separate from the
  // VerificationAppendInfo because 1) when we check VerificationAppendInfo to
  // see whether it agrees with an ack, we don't want to have to worry about
  // matching the boolean acked indicator, and 2) in certain settings (e.g.
  // trimmed_cache_) we don't need whether or not the record was acked. We use
  // VerificationAppendInfo here rather than just lsn_t so that we can later
  // add other info to help us identify the error record if necessary.

  // later.

  // Cache of all sequence numbers that were in an ack list with ack status of
  // "success" (i.e. they were assigned LSN), but were NOT in the window of
  // records (i.e. we never actually read them). This is because, if we ever
  // actually do read such a record later, it is reordering because we will have
  // seen that record in an ack list before actually reading that record.
  // Explanation: records are moved onto the to-ack list only after their append
  // callbacks, so if record y's ack list--a snapshot of the to-ack list at the
  // time append(y) was called--contains record x, then append(y) must have been
  // called AFTER append_callback of x completed, and LogDevice therefore
  // guarantees that record y MUST come after record x in the log unless there
  // is reordering. Hence, if we see a record y with an ack list containing a
  // record x that we haven't read (i.e. meaning that y comes before x in the
  // log) there is reordering.
  // Note that we also store a VerificationFoundError corresponding to each
  // reordered sequence number. Each VerificationFoundError will contain the
  // following field values:
  // vrs: VerificationRecordStatus::REORDERING
  // error_record: {vsn of reordered record, its VerificationAppendInfo}
  // error_discovery_record: {vsn of record x, VerificationAppendInfo of record
  // x}, where record x = any record such that the reordered record was in x's
  // ack list before it was read.
  //
  // A note on definition of reordered records: a record x is defined as
  // reordered if and only if there exists a record y before record x, such that
  // y's ack list contains record x.
