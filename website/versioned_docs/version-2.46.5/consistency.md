The log data model of LogDevice is built on a strongly consistent Paxos consensus engine. The team selected variants of Paxos to achieve:
* fault tolerance with fewerÂ copies.
* flexible quorums for highly available, high throughput, and low latency steady-state replication.
* zero-copy quorum reconfiguration with high availability.

Please see the attached slides for a deep dive into the distributed consensus protocol in LogDevice.

We intend to provide a more in-depth technical document at a later date.
