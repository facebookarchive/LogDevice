## append\_outliers
Provides debugging information for the Sequencer Boycotting feature, which consists in boycotting sequencer nodes that are outliers when we compare their append success rate with the rest of the clusters.  This table contains the state of a few nodes in the cluster that are responsible for gathering stats from all other nodes, aggregate them and decide the list of outliers.

|   Column   |   Type   |   Description   |
|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| node\_id | int | Node ID this row is for. |
| observed\_node\_id | int | Node id for which we are measuring stats. |
| appends\_success | long | Number of appends that this node completed successfully. |
| appends\_failed | long | Number of appends that this node did not complete successfully. |
| msec\_since | long | Time in milliseconds since the node has been considered an outlier. |
| is\_outlier | bool | True if this node is considered an outlier. |

## append\_throughput
For each sequencer node, reports the estimated per-log-group append throughput over various time periods.  Because different logs in the same log group may have their sequencer on different nodes in the cluster, it is necessary to aggregate these rates across all nodes in the cluster to get an estimate of the global append throughput of a log group.  If Sequencer Batching is enabled, this table reports the rate of appends incoming, ie before batching and compression on the sequencer.

|   Column   |   Type   |   Description   |
|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| node\_id | int | Node ID this row is for. |
| log\_group\_name | string | The name of the log group. |
| throughput\_1min | long | Throughput average in the past 1 minute. |
| throughput\_5min | long | Throughput average in the past 5 minutes. |
| throughput\_10min | long | Throughput average in the past 10 minutes. |

## catchup\_queues
CatchupQueue is a state machine that manages all the read streams of one client on one socket.  It contains a queue of read streams for which there are new records to be sent to the client (we say these read streams are not caught up).  Read streams from that queue are processed (or "woken-up") in a round-robin fashion. The state machine is implemented in logdevice/common/CatchupQueue.h.

|   Column   |   Type   |   Description   |
|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| node\_id | int | Node ID this row is for. |
| client | string | Id of the client. |
| queued\_total | long | Number of read streams queued in that CatchupQueue (ie read streams that are not caught up). |
| queued\_immediate | long | Number of read streams that are not queued with a delay, see "queue\_delayed". |
| queued\_delayed | long | (Number of read streams that are queued with a delay.  When these read streams are queued, CatchupQueue waits for a configured amount of time before dequeuing the stream for processing. This happens if the log is configured with the "delivery\_latency"  option, which enables better batching of reads when tailing.  See "deliveryLatency" logdevice/include/LogAttributes.h. |
| record\_bytes\_queued | long | (CatchupQueue also does accounting of how many bytes are enqueued in the socket's output evbuffer. CatchupQueue wakes up several read streams until the buffer reaches the limit set by the option --output-max-records-kb (see logdevice/common/Settings.h). |
| storage\_task\_in\_flight | int | Each read stream is processed one by one.  When a read stream is processed, it will first try to read some records from the worker thread if there are some records that can be read from RocksDB's block cache. When all records that could be read from the worker thread were read, and if there are more records that can be read, the read stream will issue a storage task to read such records in a slow storage thread.  This flag indicates whether or not there is such a storage task currently in flight. |
| ping\_timer\_active | int | Ping timer is a timer that is used to ensure we eventually try to schedule more reads under certain conditions.  This column indicates whether the timer is currently active. |

## chunk\_rebuildings
In-flight ChunkRebuilding state machines - each responsible for re-replicating a short range of records for the same log wich consecutive LSNs and the same copyset (see ChunkRebuilding.h). See also: shard\_rebuildings, log\_rebuildings

|   Column   |   Type   |   Description   |
|------------|:--------:|-----------------|

| oldest\_timestamp | time | Timestamp of the first record in the chunk. |
| stores\_in\_flight | long | Number of records for which we're in the process of storing new copies. |

| amend\_self\_in\_flight | long | Number of records for which we're in the process of amending copysets of our own copy. |
| started | time | Time when the ChunkRebuilding was started. |

## client\_read\_streams
ClientReadStream is the state machine responsible for reading records of a log on the client side.  The state machine connects to all storage nodes that may contain data for a log and request them to send new records as they are appended to the log.  For each ClientReadStream there is one ServerReadStream per storage node the ClientReadStream is talking to.  The "readers" table lists all existing ServerReadStreams.  Because LDQuery does not fetch any debugging information from clients connected to the cluster, the only ClientReadStreams that will be shown in this table are for internal read streams on the server.

|   Column   |   Type   |   Description   |
|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| node\_id | int | Node ID this row is for. |
| log\_id | log_id | Id of the log being read. |
| id | long | Internal identifier for the read stream. |
| next\_lsn\_to\_deliver | long | Next LSN that needs to be delivered to the client. |
| window\_high | lsn | Current window.  This is used for flow control.  ClientReadStream instructs storage nodes to not send records with LSNs higher than this value.  ClientReadStream slides the window as it is able to make progress (see the --client-read-flow-control-threshold setting). |
| until\_lsn | lsn | LSN up to which the ClientReadStream must read. |
| read\_set\_size | long | Number of storage nodes this ClientReadStream is reading from.  Usally equal to the size of the log's nodeset but may be smaller if some nodes from that nodeset are rebuilding. |
| gap\_end\_outside\_window | lsn | Sometimes there are no more records to deliver that have a LSN smaller than "window\_high".  When a storage node reaches the end of the window, it sends a GAP message to inform of the next LSN it will be able to ship past the window.  This value is the smallest LSN greater than "window\_high" reported by storage nodes and is used for determining the right endpoint of a gap interval in such a situation. |
| trim\_point | lsn | When a storage node reaches a log's trim point, it informs ClientReadStream through a gap message.  This is ClientReadStream's current view of the log's trim point. |
| gap\_nodes\_next\_lsn | string | Contains the list of nodes for which we know they don't have a record with LSN "next\_lsn\_to\_deliver".  Alongside the node id is the LSN of the next record or gap this storage node is expected to send us. |
| unavailable\_nodes | string | List of nodes that ClientReadStream knows are unavailable and thus is not trying to read from. |
| connection\_health | string | Summary of authoritative status of the read session. An AUTHORITATIVE session has a least an f-majority of nodes participating. Reported dataloss indicates all copies of a record were lost, or, much less likely, the only copies of the data are on the R-1 nodes that are currently unavailable, and the cluster failed to detect or remediate the failure that caused some copies to be lost. A NON\_AUTHORITATIVE session has less than an f-majority of nodes participating, but those not participating have had detected failures, are not expected to participate, and are being rebuilt. Most readers will stall in this case. Readers that proceed can see dataloss gaps for records that are merely currently unavailable, but will become readable once failed nodes are repaired.  An UNHEALTHY session has too many storage nodes down but not marked as failed, to be able to read even non-authoritatively. |
| redelivery\_inprog | bool | True if a retry of delivery to the application is outstanding. |
| filter\_version | long | Read session version.  This is bumped every time parameters (start, until, SCD, etc.) are changed by the client. |

## cluster\_state
Fetches the state of the gossip-based failure detector from the nodes of the cluster.  When the status column is OK, the dead\_nodes column contains a list of dead nodes as seen by the node in question. When status is OK, the unhealthy\_nodes column contains a list of unhealthy nodes as seen by the node in question. When status is OK, the overloaded\_nodes column contains a list of overloaded nodes as seen by the node in question. When the status is anything but OK, it means the request failed for this node, and it may be dead itself.

|   Column   |   Type   |   Description   |
|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| node\_id | long | Id of the node. |
| status | string | Status of the node. |
| dead\_nodes | string | List of node IDs that this node believes to be dead. |

|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| log\_id | log_id | Id of the log. |
| status | string | "OK" if the query to the epoch store succeeded for that log id.  If the log could not be found (which only happens if the user provided query constraints on the "log\_id" column), set to NOTFOUND.

| nodeset\_seed | long | Random seed used when selecting nodeset. |
| lce | long | Last epoch considered clean for this log.  Under normal conditions, this is equal to "epoch" - 2.   If this value is smaller, this means that the current sequencer needs to run the Log Recovery procedure on epochs ["lce" + 1, "epoch" - 2] and readers will be unable to read data in these epochs until they are cleaned. |
| meta\_lce | long | Same as "lce" but for the metadata log of this data log. |
| written\_by | string | Id of the last node in the cluster that updated the epoch store for that log. |
| tail\_record | string | Human readable string that describes tail record |

## event\_log

| snapshot\_replay\_tail | lsn | On startup, the state machine reads the snapshot log up to that lsn before delivering the initial state to subscribers. |
| stalled\_waiting\_for\_snapshot | lsn | If not null, this means the state machine is stalled because it missed data in the delta log either because it saw a DATALOSS or TRIM gap.  The state machine will be stalled until it sees a snapshot with a version greather than this LSN.  Unless another node writes a snapshot with a bigger version, the operator may have to manually write a snapshot to recover the state machine. |
| delta\_appends\_in\_flight | long | How many deltas are currently being appended to the delta log by this node. |
| deltas\_pending\_confirmation | long | How many deltas are currently pending confirmation on this node, ie these are deltas currently being written with the CONFIRM\_APPLIED flag, and the node is waiting for the RSM to sync up to that delta's version to confirm whether or not it was applied. |
| snapshot\_in\_flight | long | Whether a snapshot is being appended by this node.  Only one node in the cluster is responsible for creating snapshots (typically the node with the smallest node id that's alive according to the failure detector). |
| delta\_log\_bytes | long | Number of bytes of delta records that are past the last snapshot. |
| delta\_log\_records | long | Number of delta records that are past the last snapshot. |
| delta\_log\_healthy | bool | Whether the ClientReadStream state machine used to read the delta log reports itself as healthy, ie it has enough healthy connections to the storage nodes in the delta log's storage set such that it should be able to not miss any delta. |
| propagated\_read\_ptr | lsn | All updates up to this LSN (exclusive) were fully propagated to all state machines (in particular, to RebuildingCoordinator). |

|   Column   |   Type   |   Description   |
|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| log\_id | log_id | Id of the log |
| status | string | "OK" if the query to retrieve historical metadata succeeded for that log id.  If the log is not in the config (which only happens if the user provided query constraints on the "log\_id" column), set to INVALID\_PARAM.  If we failed to read the log's historical metadata, set to one of TIMEDOUT, ACCESS, FAILED. |

|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| node\_id | int | Node ID this row is for. |

| window\_high | lsn | Current window used by the ClientReadStream. This instructs the storage node to not send records with LSNs higher than this value. When the read pointer reaches this value, the stream is caught up and the storage node will wake up the stream when the window is slid by ClientReadStream. |
| last\_released | lsn | Last LSN released for delivery by the sequencer. If this value is stale, check if purging could be the reason using the "purges" table. |
| catching\_up | int | Indicates whether or not the stream is catching up, ie there are records that can be delivered now to the client, and the stream is enqueued in a CatchupQueue (see the "catchup\_queues" table). |
| window\_end | int | Should be true if "read\_pointer" is past "window\_high". |
| known\_down | string | List of storage nodes that the ClientReadStream is not able to receive records from. This list is used so that other storage nodes can send the records that nodes in that list were supposed to send. If this columns shows "ALL\_SEND\_ALL", this means that the ClientReadStream is not running in Single-Copy-Delivery mode, meaning it requires all storage nodes to send every record they have.  This can be either because SCD is not enabled for the log, or because data is not correctly replicated and ClientReadStream is not able to reconstitute a contiguous sequencer of records from what storage nodes are sending, or because the ClientReadStream is going through an epoch boundary. |
| filter\_version | long | Each time ClientReadStream rewinds the read streams (and possibly changes the "known\_down" list), this counter is updated. Rewinding a read stream means asking the storage node to rewind to a given LSN. |
| last\_batch\_status | string | Status code that was issued when the last batch of records was read for this read stream.  See LocalLogStoreReader::read() in logdevice/common/LocalLogStore.h. |

| csid | string | Client Session ID |
| rsid | string | Read stream ID |

## record
This table allows fetching information about individual record copies in the cluster.  The user must provide query constraints on the "log\_id" and "lsn" columns.  This table can be useful to introspect where copies of a record are stored and see their metadata.  Do not use it to serve production use cases as this query runs very inneficiently (it bypasses the normal read protocol and instead performs a point query on all storage nodes in the cluster).

## record\_csi
This table allows fetching information about individual record copies in the cluster.  The user must provide query constraints on the "log\_id" and "lsn" columns.  This table can be useful to introspect where copies of a record are stored and see their metadata.  Do not use it to serve production use cases as this query runs very inneficiently (it bypasses the normal read protocol and instead performs a point query on all storage nodes in the cluster). This table is different from the record table in the sense that it only queries the copyset index and therefore can be more efficient. It can be used to check for divergence between the data and copyset index.

|   Column   |   Type   |   Description   |
|------------|:--------:|-----------------|
| node\_id | int | Node ID this row is for. |

| holes\_replicate | long | Number of holes re-replicated by this EpochRecovery. |
| holes\_conflict | long | Number of hole/record conflicts found by this EpochRecovery. |

| details | string | Reason for rebuilding this shard. |
| rebuilding\_started\_ts | string | When rebuilding was started. |
| rebuilding\_completed\_ts | string | When the shard transitioned to AUTHORITATIVE\_EMPTY. |
| mode | string | Whether the shard participates in its own rebuilding |
| acked | int | Whether the node acked the rebuilding. (Why would such nodes remain in the rebuilding set at all? No one remembers now.) |
| ack\_lsn | string | LSN of the SHARD\_ACK\_REBUILT written by this shard. |
| ack\_version | string | Version of the rebuilding that was acked. |

## shard\_rebuildings
Show debugging information about the ShardRebuilding state machines (see "logdevice/server/rebuilding/ShardRebuildingV1.h").  This state machine is responsible for running all LogRebuilding state machines (see "logs\_rebuilding" table) for all logs in a donor shard.

| version | lsn | Rebuilding version.  This version comes from the event log RSM that coordinates rebuilding.  See the "event\_log" table. |
| global\_window\_end | time | End of the global window (if enabled with --rebuilding-global-window).  This is a time window used to synchronize all ShardRebuilding state machines across all donor shards. |

| persistent\_error | int | True if we encountered an unrecoverable error when reading. Shard shouldn't stay in this state for more than a few seconds: it's expected that RebuildingCoordinator will request a rebuilding for this shard, and rebuilding will rewind without this node's participation. V2 only. |
| read\_buffer\_bytes | long | Bytes of records that we've read but haven't started re-replicating yet. V2 only. |
| records\_in\_flight | long | Number of records that are being re-replicated right now. V2 only. |
