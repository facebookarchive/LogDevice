# RocksDB hard codes the paths to the snappy libs to something
# that doesn't exist; ignoring the usual cmake rules.  As a result,
# we can't build it with snappy without either patching rocksdb or
# without introducing more complex logic to the build system to
# connect the snappy build outputs to rocksdb's custom logic here.
# Let's just turn it off on windows.
