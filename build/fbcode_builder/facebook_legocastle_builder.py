'''

Extends FBCodeBuilder to emit a Legocastle "steps".

Unlike DockerFBCodeBuilder, which either checks out a Github repository, or
copies a local one, this builder is designed to get code for projects that
use `fb_github_project_workdir` from the local fbsource repository.

See `facebook_fbsource_utils.py` and `facebook_make_legocastle_job.py` for
the details of how Github-analogous code is obtained.

This file simply enumerates the project needing this special treatment, and
emits a sequence of bash-command steps that expect the projects to be on
disk (provided via a Legocastle bundle).
